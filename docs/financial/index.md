The financial aspect of the qSelf project tracks and processes expenses, investments, income, assets, and logistics:

* **Expenses:** The fundamental unit tracked is transactions. For more information see the [Transactions](transactions) page.
* **Investment:** The investment portfolio is tracked using transaction data, with extra information, and is stored in the investment table. For more information see the [Investment](investment) page.
* **Assets and Logistics:** Records asset purchases and monitors their value, state, and location with a logistics component. For more information see the [Assets](assets) page.

## Reconciliation
To keep financial information accurate, the reconciliation flows run on a set schedule to check that the liquid money available, investment portfolio value, asset value, and other balances correspond with the reality. This is the primary function of the `4 Finances` flow, which serves all the other financial subflows.
